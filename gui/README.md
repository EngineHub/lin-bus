lin-bus NBT editor
==================

This is a JavaFX-based editor for NBT files. It serves as an example of what you can do with this API, as well as a 
modern editor for NBT files. It is not yet feature-complete on the editing side, but it works great to view files.

## TODO

- Add/remove entries
- Undo/redo changes
- Refine editing UX/design
- Right-click menus for easier access to common actions
