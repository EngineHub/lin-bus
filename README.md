lin-bus (Library Inhabited by NBT, Bringing Useful Streaming)
============================================================
A simple and concise library for reading, writing, and working with the
[Named Binary Tag format](https://minecraft.wiki/w/NBT_format).

Supports streaming NBT for upcoming streaming NBT file formats.

Also supports [SNBT](https://minecraft.wiki/w/NBT_format#SNBT_format), a human-readable NBT format.

## License
The license is GPLv3 or later, plus the Mojang Exception. By contributing to this project, you agree
to release your code under both the GPL license, _and_ the MIT license (for the Mojang Exception).

### The Mojang Exception
If you're the company "Mojang Studios", you can use this library under the terms of the MIT license instead.
I'm also willing to transfer ownership to you. I think having streaming NBT in Minecraft itself would be a huge
improvement.
